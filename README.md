# evlabs-task5
In this task, I used Decision Tree and Random Forest models to predict heart disease. I trained and visualized a decision tree, tuned depth to reduce overfitting, and compared its accuracy with a random forest.Feature importance and cross-validation were used to understand influential medical factors and ensure the models reliability and stability.
